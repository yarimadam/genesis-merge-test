*Adding a Migration
    At the very first time, you defined the initial domain classes. At this point, there is no database for your application which can store the data from your domain classes. So, firstly, you need to create a migration.

    Open the Package Manager Console from the menu Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and execute the following command to add a migration.

    PM> add-migration MyFirstMigration
    
    If you are using dotnet Command Line Interface, execute the following command.

    CLI> dotnet ef migrations add MyFirstMigration
    
    In the above commands, MyFirstMigration is the name of a migration. This will create three files in the Migrations folder of your project, as shown below.


*Creating or Updating the Database
    Use the following command to create or update the database schema.

    Package Manager Console
    PM> Update-Database
    CLI> dotnet ef database update
    
    The Update command will create the database based on the context and domain classes and the migration snapshot, which is created using the add-migration or add command.


*Removing a Migration
    You can remove the last migration if it is not applied to the database. Use the following remove commands to remove the last created migration files and revert the model snapshot.

    Package Manager Console
    PM> remove-migration
    CLI> dotnet ef migrations remove
    
    The above commands will remove the last migration and revert the model snapshot to the previous migration. Please note that if a migration is already applied to the database, then it will throw the following exception.


*Reverting a Migration
    Suppose you changed your domain class and created the second migration named MySecondMigration using the add-migration command and applied this migration to the database using the Update command. But, for some reason, you want to revert the database to the previous state. In this case, use the update-database <migration name> command to revert the database to the specified previous migration snapshot.

    Package Manager Console
    PM> Update-database MyFirstMigration
    CLI> dotnet ef database update MyFirstMigration.
    
    The above command will revert the database based on a migration named MyFirstMigration and remove all the changes applied for the second migration named MySecondMigration. This will also remove MySecondMigration entry from the __EFMigrationsHistory table in the database.
